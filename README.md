# Readme File_All about Happy Customers Project

Summary

This project deepened my machine learning knowledge significantly and I strengthened my ability to apply concepts that I learned from textbooks, blogs and various other sources, on a different type of problem. This project had a heavy focus on the data preparation part, since this is what data scientists work on most of their time.

I started with the data exploration where I got a feeling for the dataset, checked about missing data and learned which features are important. During this process I used seaborn and matplotlib to do the visualizations. During the data preprocessing part, I computed missing values, there's no missing values in the data set.

Afterwards I started training 6 different machine learning models. The best accuracy result is from KNN Algorithm 76.9%. I picked one of them (random forest) and applied hyper parameter tuning, scaling and cross validation on it. Then I explained how random forest works, took a look at the importance it assigns to the different features and tuned it's performace through optimizing it's hyperparameter values. The accuracy is improving after applying hyper parameter tuning, scaling and cross validation techniques. Lastly I took a look at it's confusion matrix and computed the models precision, recall and f-score, before submitting my predictions on the test-set.

Finally, I am getting best accuracy from KNN Algorithm compared to all other 5 algorithms.
